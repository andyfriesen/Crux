Crux is a principled, practical AltJS language.  It aims to sacrifice nothing.

# Core Principles

* Hindley-Milner static types all the way
* Accessible to humans
* Small code
* Fast code
* Clean mapping to raw JS
* Solid asynchronous programming

# Feature Wishlist

* Full static type inference
* Typeclasses

# Status

I give this project a 1% shot at eventually becoming useful enough to compile itself.
