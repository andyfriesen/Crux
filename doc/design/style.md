Names:

Functions are camelCase.
Types are UpperCase.

Acronyms or words like JSON should be spelled with the appropriate capitalization
given the context, but as they would be written in English or prose.

JSONDecoder, IRCConnection as types.
jsonDecoder, ircConnection as values.

Whether it's an acronym or not doesn't matter: the code should simply line up
with the spelling and capitalization in the documentation.
